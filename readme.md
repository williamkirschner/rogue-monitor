# Rogue Fitness Equipment Monitor
A simple script to monitor Rogue Fitness' website and notify me through text
(via Twilio) when an item is in stock. Due to the nature of the site and
personal coding limitations, various scripts are meant to monitor specific item
types (e.g. barbells, plates, etc.).
